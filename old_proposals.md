#301 - Motion to propose new rule governing the generating of random numbers - failed

Proposed by: Peter Kuehne -10pts

This proposal would create rule 301: Random Number Generation, with the text:

> Where a random number is required by a rule, such a number shall be determined by the throw of a dice. 

> Where the number range required exceeds that of a six-sided dice, the minimum number of dice shall be thrown such that when added together their total exceeds the required number range.

> Where a thrown number exceeds the required range all dice shall immediately be rethrown until a number in the required range is thrown. 

> All throws shall be carried out by the Speaker in the presence of a Quorum of Players.

Speaker's consent: refused - 66% majority required.

Notes: throws being required to be carried out in the presence of a quorum of players is impractible.

Quorum: 1 vote.

Voting status: 3-2 in favour - failed.

> 1) A date shall be chosen such that:

> b) The date shall not be in the past.

> c) The date shall be the earliest valid date in the future.

> d) If the London Stock Exchange has already closed on that date, it is considered to be in the past, and invalid.

> 2) Let X equal the closing price of the FTSE 100 on that date, as given by http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/UKX:IND in GBp.

> 3) If X is non-integral, it shall be multiplied by 10 until it is an integer.

> 4) If a minimum and a maximum value are specified, let X = min + (X % max)

> 5) X is the random integer.
