#301 - Motion to propose new rule governing the generating of random numbers

Proposed by: Peter Kuehne

This proposal would create rule 301: Random Number Generation, with the text:

> Where a random number is required by a rule, such a number shall be determined by the throw of a dice. 

> Where the number range required exceeds that of a six-sided dice, the minimum number of dice shall be thrown such that when added together their total exceeds the required number range.

> Where a thrown number exceeds the required range all dice shall immediately be rethrown until a number in the required range is thrown. 

> All throws shall be carried out by the Speaker in the presence of a Quorum of Players.

Please send votes to the speaker.

Speaker's note: this proposal may require consent, under rule 209. Quorum is defined in rule 201.

Quorum: 1 vote.

Voting status: open until 29th September 2016, 11:18 BST.
