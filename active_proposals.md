#316 - Rule Language Requirements

Proposed by: Murray Colpman

This proposal would create rule 316 with the text:

> All rules must use only English-language words that appear in the Oxford English Dictionary (for avoidance of doubt, the specific version of the Oxford English Dictionary shall be the one available from http://www.oed.com ), and are provided therein with a definition matching one that can, by a reasonable interpretation in the context provided, be inferred to be the definition intended. A word not appearing in the Oxford English Dictionary is acceptable only if:

> 1. It is a proper noun, or
> 2. Both of these conditions apply:  
>   i. It is an English-language word, and  
>  ii. unambiguous replacement of said word with a conforming alternative would require more than five (5) additional words to be used.

> Any rule proposed that violates this rule will be rejected. Should such a violation not be recognised until after acceptance, the rule shall be nullified for the remainder of the game. However, this will not be applied retroactively.

Quorum: 2 votes.

#317 - US Presential Election Predictions

Proposed by: Nakul Khanna

This proposal would create rule 317 with the text:

> Each player has the opportunity to make a prediction for the US Presidential Election for a one-time point bonus.

> The prediction is of the value (Clinton vote percentage - Trump vote percentage), rounded to the nearest integer. Thus a positive figure indicates a Clinton lead, and a negative figure indicates a Trump lead.

> Point bonuses are as follows:
> - 30 points for the closest prediction
> - 20 points for the second closest
> - 10 for the furthest

> If two players are tied, both receive the full bonus for that tier. If two or more players have received 30 points, no players may receive 20 points.

> In the event that either Clinton or Trump does not compete in the general election, the more general formula (Democratic candidate vote percentage - Republican candidate vote percentage) will be used.

> Predictions are public information.

Quorum: 2 votes.
