#316 - Rule Language Requirements

Proposed by: Murray Colpman

This proposal would create rule 316 with the text:

> All rules must use only English-language words that appear in the Oxford English Dictionary (for avoidance of doubt, the specific version of the Oxford English Dictionary shall be the one available from http://www.oed.com ), and are provided therein with a definition matching one that can, by a reasonable interpretation in the context provided, be inferred to be the definition intended. A word not appearing in the Oxford English Dictionary is acceptable only if:

> 1. It is a proper noun, or
> 2. Both of these conditions apply:  
>   i. It is an English-language word, and  
>  ii. unambiguous replacement of said word with a conforming alternative would require more than five (5) additional words to be used.

> Any rule proposed that violates this rule will be rejected. Should such a violation not be recognised until after acceptance, the rule shall be nullified for the remainder of the game. However, this will not be applied retroactively.

Quorum: 2 votes.

#317 - US Presential Election Predictions

Proposed by: Nakul Khanna

This proposal would create rule 317 with the text:

> Each player has the opportunity to make a prediction for the US Presidential Election for a one-time point bonus.

> The prediction is of the value (Clinton vote percentage - Trump vote percentage), rounded to the nearest integer. Thus a positive figure indicates a Clinton lead, and a negative figure indicates a Trump lead.

> Point bonuses are as follows:
> - 30 points for the closest prediction
> - 20 points for the second closest
> - 10 for the furthest

> If two players are tied, both receive the full bonus for that tier. If two or more players have received 30 points, no players may receive 20 points.

> In the event that either Clinton or Trump does not compete in the general election, the more general formula (Democratic candidate vote percentage - Republican candidate vote percentage) will be used.

> Predictions are public information.

Speaker note: Popular vote percentage shall be used.

Quorum: 2 votes.

#318 - Repeal 314

Proposed by: Nakul Khanna

This proposal would entirely repeal rule 314 (Investing).

Quorum: 2 votes.

Status: Voting open until 21st October 2016, 10:32 BST

#319 - SUPER-PROPOSALS

Proposed by: Arkady English

This proposal would create rule 319:

> A voter may submit multiple proposals, grouped into a super-proposal. Each individual proposal will be handled individually, as given elsewhere in the rules. However: a vote on any individual proposal is applied to ALL proposals in the super-proposal. All sub-proposals must pass individually. If any sub-proposal is defeated, all proposals in the super-proposal are defeated.

Quorum: 2 votes.

#320 - OBJECT ORIENTATED NOMIC'ING

Proposed by: Arkady English

This proposal would create rule 320:

> This rule allows the creation of stateful game objects.

> The term "game entity" or "entity" is used to refer to players, objects, or anything identified as such in the rules.

> Other rules which define objects override this rule.

> This rule does not define any objects that can be created.

> Rules which define an object are only active if this rule is active.

> However, actual objects may outlast the rules which allowed their creation. If a rule defining an object is amended or repealed, the actual objects already in existence do not automatically change or get destroyed and continue to have the properties they had when they were created. If this rule gets repealed, all objects are destroyed.

> Objects may be defined as a type of other object. If a rule says that "X is a Y" or "X is a type of Y", then X objects have all the properties of a Y object, and may be treated as a Y object.

> The speaker will keep track of objects' states.

> Objects may only exist in non-negative integer quantities. Any effect which would create or transfer a non-integer number of objects will round down to the nearest integer. If a quantity of existing objects would be negative, it is immediately set to zero instead. (However: creating -10 objects in a particular pool would instead be interpreted as "destroy 10 objects in that pool", and is valid. If this would leave the pool with less than 0 objects, the pool ends up with 0 objects instead.)

> Object types should have a unique and unambiguous name. If two object types have, in the opinion of the speaker, confusingly similar names then the speaker may alter one or all such names of the objects, as well as all references in the rules and any existing proposals. Any player may create a call for judgement to the effect that names are too similar. If this is judged to be true, then the speaker is required to make such changes. Changing the name of an object in this way also updates all references to it - no substantial change can be made this way.

> Proposals may interact with objects (e.g. create them, destroy them, transfer them, or otherwise alter their state). This may be combined with rule alterations, as defined elsewhere in the rules. Proposals to interact with an object follow the same voting rules as a proposal to create a new rule. If combined with a rule alteration, the proposal must also pass according to the voting rules for the rules alteration in order to be effective. 

> If players can spend an object in any way (e.g. Destroying them or transferring them to perform an action) then they must spend a non-negative number of objects, and cannot spend more than they own.

> Unless otherwise stated, objects have the following properties:
> - Ownership: an object may be owned by any entity. Objects with no owner may be destroyed by the speaker.
> - Transferrable: the owner of an object may transfer ownership to any entity capable of owning the object, or set the ownership to none.
> - Destructable: the owner of an object may destroy it.
> - Publicity: the existence and state of an object are public knowledge.

Quorum: 2 votes.

#321 - CLEAN UP POWER

Proposed by: Arkady English

This proposal would create rule 321:

> At the speaker's discretion, the speaker may make alterations to the rules to beautify them. Valid changes include:

> - Adding or removing line breaks and/or whitespace.
> - Re-ordering the rules.
> - Changing the titles of rules.
> - Re-formatting lists.

> If the speaker wishes to change the wording (including punctuation) of any rule in order to clarify it, they make a proposal to do so with the normal voting period, and 0 quorum, which passes as long as no player votes against it. These changes may not be substantial changes to the rules, and as such these changes do not constitute a rule change, as defined under rule 105.

Quorum: 2 votes.
