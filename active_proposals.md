#316 - Automatic repealing of winning rules

Proposed by: Murray Colpman

This proposal would add rule 316, with the text:

> Immediately after a game is reset by a player winning, the rule which defined the number of points they gained that caused their score to pass the winning threshold is automatically repealed. This applies only if the rule is mutable.

> For compatibility with immutable rule 108, a vote with a quorum of 0 that requires no majority to pass will take place and immediately finish with a "for" result. The Rule Change will not at any stage be said to be "proposed".'

Quorum: 2 votes.
