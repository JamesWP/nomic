#308 - Scoring updates

Proposed by: James Peach

This proposal would amend rule 211, causing it to become rule 308:

> Voters who voted against proposals which are adopted receive 10 points apiece. 
*Voters who voted for proposals which do not get adopted receive 10 points apiece.*
Players whose proposals are adopted shall receive a random number of points in the range 1-10 inclusive.
Players whose proposals are not adopted shall lose 10 points.

Speaker's note: If a rule has its number changed by another proposal, existing proposals will instead refer to the new rule.

#309 - Investing

Proposed by: Harry Jeffery

This proposal would create rule 309, with the text:

> A player may choose to invest their points in the stock market.

> The process of investing is as follows:

> 1) The player must declare their investment to the speaker.  

> a) The declaration must be made at least a day in advance of the open date.
 
 > b) The player must specify which security they wish to invest in.
  
  >c) The player must specify an open date, and a close date.
   
   >i) Both the open date, and close date must be in the future.
    
   > ii) The close date may not be before the open date, but may be the same as the open date.
   
   > d) The player must specify how many points they shall be investing.

> 2) On the specified open date the speaker shall:
  
  > a) Deduct the invested points from the player.
  
  >b) Make a note of the opening price of the specified security on that date, as published by Bloomberg. This shall be the open price.

> 3) On the specified close date the speaker shall:
  
  > a) Make a note of the closing price of the specified security on that date, as published by Bloomberg. This shall be the close price.
 
 > b) Award the player X points, where X is equal to the points invested, multiplied by the close price, divided by the open price.

> Additional restrictions:

> 1) All investments are confidential. The speaker may not publicise or disclose one player's investments to another.

> 2) Once an investment has been declared to the speaker, it is binding. The player may not cancel their investment.

>3) All securities with a price published by Bloomberg are acceptable investments.

This proposal may require the speaker's consent.
